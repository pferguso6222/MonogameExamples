This is a collection of MonoGame demos I am developing as building blocks to make a game. Each project, with the exception of the GameTemplate project demonstrates a single useage of each of the major classes I am developing. So far, I have the following:

Loading, and parallax scrolling of TMX tilemaps using Monogame Extended.

Animating 9 slice sprites, with scaleable or tileable center sections.

Bitmap Font dialog boxes that animate text, do wrapping within a given rectangle.

An FLC file player for old school cut scenes.

File Loading and Saving for savegames.

These projects will be available for study indefinitely. The Game Template will eventually be no longer supported and moved into a private repository.
